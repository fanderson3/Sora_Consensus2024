Hey SORA Community! Lets Talk!

Who? : all members of our beloved SORA community are invited.  dreamers, builders, degens, complainers and meme enjoyers. 

What? :  discussion / consideration of working towards SORA participation in the upcoming Consensus 2024 event by submitting to the event organizers a well conceived and prepared proposal for a panel discussion on a topic that is relevant to our project 

When? : Near term – preliminary discussions can be scheduled to take place in the next 2 weeks to be positioned for organized community action if we decide to go forward with the proposal. Let’s plan the meet up in our community telegram channels. 

Why? :  

- By coming together and talking about this this idea, and perhaps even moving to an on-chain vote to decide yes or no on the question of funding SORA participation, we can strengthen our community communication and participation in SORA    governance. 
    
- We can all consider a potentially beneficial way for the SORA community to engage with the wider cryptocurrency, blockchain, and Web3 community. 
    
- SORA community members can use this occasion to learn how to vote on chain.
    
- If we vote yes to move forward, by the SORA community submitting a well prepared plan for a panel discussion we will increase awareness of SORA among the
    crypto / Web3 community and the Consensus 2024 curator team and show the world that we have active community participation, governance and engagement with the wider blockchain community
    
- If the SORA submission is selected by the Consensus community and the Consensus 2024 curator team, we will have the incredible opportunity to hold a panel discussion that includes topics 
  that we select in front of a large audience in late May 2024. 
    
- By doing these things we increase the value of SORA to the world, we will be enabling economic growth and we will spawn the creation of new purchasing power

What is this event that Sora could participate in? What is Consensus 2024 ?

Consensus is the world's largest, longest-running and most influential gathering that brings together all sides of the cryptocurrency, blockchain and Web3 community.
From hard-hitting conversations with visionary speakers to hands-on workshops aimed at solving industry challenges, developers, investors, founders, brands, policymakers and more will walk away with the tools and insights needed to continue laying the foundation of a more decentralized future.
It is called “Consensus” for a reason. This event is the primary forum where the industry comes together to discuss the most pivotal matters of the day, highlight the biggest successes and debate the most critical conversations.
Consensus 2024 is your chance to be a part of the most important conversation in crypto and Web3


Second – What is the proposed action that we SORA community members can discuss and perhaps vote on? 
The organizers of Consensus 2024 have announced a call to the Consensus community for proposals for speakers and even panel discussions. The Consensus community will vote on the proposals and the finalists will go to the organizers to review and pick the winners. Please see : https://consensus2024.coindesk.com/community-submissions/
If the SORA community decide this is worth the cost, the decentralized SORA community could form a volunteer working group to collaborate in order to formulate and present a well thought out and attractive, professional proposal for a panel discussion where our ideas and our project can be discussed in front of a target audience. SORA could vote to provide funding for some elements of the proposal packaging and presentation like graphic design services, layout, and other elements that may make our proposal to the Consensus community attractive and effective. 
If the proposal from the SORA community is selected and we are asked to implement our proposal for a panel discussion, the SORA community can fund expenses such as all the travel expenses for the participants so that they can represent our ideals and our ideas and SORA in front of the world.
